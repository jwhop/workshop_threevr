# Chapter 04 - Playing with the camera

This example can be seen [here](https://nicolaspe.github.io/workshop_threevr/camera.html).


On chapter 1, we saw the basic parameters to set up a camera, but what do they do? How do they change when the camera moves?


In order to understand how some parameters of the camera work, it's easier seeing it in action. Whenever the camera moves, the `position` and `rotation` of the camera changes. The position can be altered manually on the code, but the rotation works differently, and has to be corrected by changing the [`quaternion`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/math/Quaternion).


When talking about the *field of view* things are more complicated. How it works is rather simple, but changing it requires an additional step: updating the camera's projection matrix. Without this update, the change on the *fov* will not be reflected on the sketch.

```JavaScript
fov_slider = document.querySelector("#fov_sl");
fov_slider.addEventListener("change", function() {
  camera.fov = +fov_slider.value;
  camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
});
```
