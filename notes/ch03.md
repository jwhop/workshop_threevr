# Chapter 03 - Animation

In order to add some animation to the sketch, we need to modify our objects in every frame. The place to do this is the function we set up as the animation loop referenced earlier.

In order to move, rotate or scale an object (or modify any [property](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/core/Object3D)), we can access each coordinate of the parameters individually or set them all at once.

```JavaScript
obj.position.x = 0;
obj.rotation.set( 0, 0.2, 0.5 );
```


It is useful to have a way to keep track of the time (or frames) passed. It can be as simple as having a counter go up every loop, or use the JavaScript built in function [`performance.now()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now).


```JavaScript
let timekeep = 0;

function render(){
	timekeep += 0.01;
  let time = performance.now() * 0.00002;
	moveSpheres();

	controls.update();
  renderer.render( scene, camera );
}

function moveSpheres(){
	sphere1.position.z = Math.sin(timekeep)*150;
	sphere2.position.x = Math.sin(timekeep)*150;
}
```
