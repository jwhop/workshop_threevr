# Chapter 02 - Object creation and textures


## Some more useful elements
#### `controls`
This is used to control the camera. Some usual controls are the [OrbitControls](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/controls/OrbitControls) and [FlyControls](https://threejs.org/examples/misc_controls_fly.html). They need to be constantly updated on the *animation loop*.


#### `loader`
A [texture loader](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/loaders/TextureLoader). It needs to be created only once to be used whenever.

Note that this is only to load images (textures), but there are many different loaders for [animations](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/loaders/AnimationLoader), [audio](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/loaders/AudioLoader), [3D obj files](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/loaders/OBJLoader) and more!



## Object creation
To create an element (or a [Mesh](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/objects/Mesh)) in three.js you need two essential parts: a [geometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/core/Geometry) and a mesh [material](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/constants/Materials).

- A **geometry** is a set of *vertices* (points in space) and *faces* (sets of 3 vertices that form a plane). Luckily, three.js has A LOT of built in shapes for our convenience (i.e: [sphere](https://threejs.org/docs/api/geometries/SphereGeometry.html), [box](https://threejs.org/docs/api/geometries/BoxGeometry.html), [torus](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/geometries/TorusGeometry), etc).

- A mesh **material** is a set of properties that give a basic texture to the material. Depending on the properties we want, we could use a [Basic material](https://threejs.org/docs/api/materials/MeshBasicMaterial.html) (which is flat and unaffected by lights), a [Lambert material](https://threejs.org/docs/api/materials/MeshLambertMaterial.html) (which is reflectant, but not shiny), a [Phong material](https://threejs.org/docs/api/materials/MeshPhongMaterial.html) (very shiny!), or others. We can also specify other properties, as a mapped texture, specular or emissive properties, the side of the material (it can be displayed inside for a sky dome -an enormous sphere that acts as the sky- , or only on the outside for a normal object), to display only the wireframe, etc.

After defining this elements, to create the object you simply assign them to a Mesh, set its position and rotation, and add them to the scene:
  ```JavaScript
  var obj = new Mesh(obj_geometry, obj_material);
  obj.position.set(pos_x, pos_y, pos_z);
  obj.rotation.set(rot_x, rot_y, rot_z);
  scene.add(obj);
  ```

Also, it is worth noting that while these geometries and materials are often saved as variables, they are not linked to the specific Mesh. Thus, they can be used over and over again, instead of creating new geometries or materials.

We can also create [lights](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/lights/Light). They don't need a geometry and texture, only a color and intensity; but they also have some special parameters depending on their type. These elements also have to be added to the scene (very common mistake!). Some examples are:

- an [Ambient light](https://threejs.org/docs/api/lights/AmbientLight.html) is an omnipresent light, illuminating all the objects on the scene. As such, it casts no shadows

- a [Directional light](https://threejs.org/docs/api/lights/DirectionalLight.html) is a light from a faraway source, illuminating every object from a specific direction

- a [Point light](https://threejs.org/docs/api/lights/PointLight.html) comes from a very specific point in space and emits light in every direction. It's distance and decay properties can be set to get a more realistic simulation
