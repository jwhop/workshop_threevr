# Chapter 06 - WebVR!!!

Now, let's go to the point of all this. Fortunately, there's not much code to add to make a VR scene work!


## [Origin Trials](https://bit.ly/OriginTrials)
But first, we need to sign up for the Origin Trial. This allows developers to try out experimental features and give feedback about them. All you need to do is [request a token for your site](http://bit.ly/OriginTrialSignup) and add the tag on your website (just follow the instructions on the site and email).

## Libraries
Now we need a few libraries to make this work (which can be found on this repository, on the `lib/` folder or linked to the latest build):

- [WebVR](https://webvr.info/): library that implements the WebVR API
- [webvr-polyfill](https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill) & [webxr-polyfill](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-polyfill): libraries needed to display on unsupported devices/browsers

There are two libraries that were needed before, but have been added to the basic renderer and APIs of three.js and WebVR: `VREffect` and `VRControls`.

<br/>
In addition to these libraries, as we're developing in a computer, we'll need the [Chrome WebVR API Emulation](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webvr-api-emulation/gbdnpaebafagioggnhkacnaaahpiefil). This tool appears on the Developer Tools tab, as the "WebVR" tab. This lets us enter VR mode by emulating a VR display in the browser and control the camera on the sketch. Sadly, with the latest changes this doesn't always work on web projects, only when accessing it locally (localhost).



## Implementation
Things change quickly with implementations of emerging technologies like this one. On the downside, code you previously had stops working, libraries and functions get deprecated and even the platform might change and break everything. But, on the upside, experiments get stable releases and extra code gets incorporated into the basic libraries. This is the case with WebVR: while version 2.0 got merged into [WebXR](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/), we still have [version 1.1](https://immersive-web.github.io/webvr/spec/1.1/)


1. Enable the VR mode on the renderer.
  ```JavaScript
  renderer.vr.enabled = true;
  ```

2. Create the "Enter VR" button. This is part of the WebVR API library and deals with getting the `VRDisplay` and setting up the callback function for it to start presenting.
  ```JavaScript
  vrButton = WEBVR.createButton( renderer );
  document.getElementById('vr_button').appendChild( vrButton );
  ```


And that's it! Your project can now run in VR mode ðŸ˜ƒ A few other details were added to the code, you can inspect and play with it as you wish.
